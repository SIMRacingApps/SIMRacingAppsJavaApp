To run this sample Java App, you must add the SIMRacingApps Server to the classpath as follows:

java -classpath "{pathToServer}/SIMRacingAppsServer...exe" SIMRacingAppsJavaApp.SIMRacingAppsJavaApp

You can get the Server from http://downloads.SIMRacingApps.com. It doesn't have to be running. But if it is, then you will have access to all of the Java documentation from the menu.
